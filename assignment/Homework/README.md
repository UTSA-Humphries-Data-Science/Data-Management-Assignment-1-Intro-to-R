# Homework Assignment - Lesson 1: Introduction to R

**Due Date:** [Your instructor will specify]  
**Points:** 30 points total

**Instructions:**

*   Complete the following tasks in an R script (`.R` file) or an R Markdown document (`.Rmd` file).
*   Name your file `homework_lesson_1.R` or `homework_lesson_1.Rmd`
*   Save your file in this folder (`assignment/Homework/`)
*   Ensure your code is well-commented and easy to understand.
*   Commit and push your completed assignment to submit.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** The data files (`sales_data.csv` and `customer_feedback.xlsx`) are already provided in the `data/` folder at the root of this repository.

## Part 1: Setting Up Your Environment and Importing Data

1.  **Working Directory:**
    *   You are already in the correct Codespaces environment - no need to create folders.
    *   Verify your current working directory using `getwd()`.
    *   Your working directory should be `/workspaces/Data-Management-Assignment-1-Intro-to-R`

2.  **Package Installation & Loading:**
    *   The required packages are already installed in this environment.
    *   Load `tidyverse` and `readxl` packages into your R session.

3.  **Data Import - CSV:**
    *   The `sales_data.csv` file is located in the `data/` folder.
    *   Import it using: `sales_df <- read_csv("data/sales_data.csv")`

4.  **Data Import - Excel:**
    *   The `customer_feedback.xlsx` file is located in the `data/` folder.
    *   Import the `Ratings` sheet: `ratings_df <- read_excel("data/customer_feedback.xlsx", sheet = "Ratings")`
    *   Import the `Comments` sheet: `comments_df <- read_excel("data/customer_feedback.xlsx", sheet = "Comments")`

## Part 2: Basic Data Inspection

Perform the following inspection tasks for each of the three data frames you imported (`sales_df`, `ratings_df`, `comments_df`). For each data frame, provide the R code and the output, along with a brief interpretation of what you observe.

1.  **First Few Rows:** Display the first 10 rows of each data frame.
2.  **Structure:** Display the structure (data types, number of observations/variables) of each data frame.
3.  **Summary Statistics:** Display summary statistics for each data frame.
4.  **Visual Inspection (Optional, but Recommended):** If your VS Code setup allows, use `View()` to open each data frame in the data viewer and briefly describe any immediate observations (e.g., presence of missing values, unexpected values).

## üìã Submission Checklist

Before submitting your assignment, make sure you have:

- [ ] Created a file named `homework_lesson_1.R` or `homework_lesson_1.Rmd` in this folder
- [ ] Completed all tasks in Parts 1, 2, and 3
- [ ] Added comments to explain your code
- [ ] Tested that your code runs without errors
- [ ] Answered all reflection questions
- [ ] Committed your changes: `git add . && git commit -m "Complete assignment 1"`
- [ ] Pushed to GitHub: `git push origin main`

## üÜò Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
1. Check that your file is saved in the correct location (`assignment/Homework/`)
2. Verify your code runs without errors in the R console
3. Make sure you've committed and pushed your changes
4. Contact your instructor if you need assistance

**Good luck with your assignment! üéØ**

## Part 3: Reflection Questions

Answer the following questions in your submission document:

1.  Based on your inspection of `sales_df`, what are the data types of the `Date` and `Amount` columns? Are these data types appropriate for typical business analytics tasks involving sales data? Explain why or why not.
2.  Looking at `ratings_df` and `comments_df`, do you notice any potential issues (e.g., missing values, inconsistent data types) that might need to be addressed in future data wrangling steps? (No need to fix them, just identify them).
3.  Why is it important to perform initial data inspection immediately after importing data? What kind of problems can it help you identify early on?
4.  Briefly explain the difference between `install.packages()` and `library()` in R. When would you use each function?

**Submission Checklist:**

*   [ ] R script Notebook file with all code and outputs.
*   [ ] Answers to reflection questions included in the document or as a separate text file.
*   [ ] All necessary data files (`sales_data.csv`, `customer_feedback.xlsx`) are accessible (e.g., in the same directory or clearly referenced).

Good luck!
